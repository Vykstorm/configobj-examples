# configobj_examples
Basic examples of usage of the library ConfigObj in python
You have few ones at the root directory on this repository.
To test them you can create a virtualenv and install dependencies using setup.py script.
Basically, it needs ConfigObj module. The version I use is the development one from Github (https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj).
because I was unable to import configobj.validate using package supplied on Pypi.

Also, to test this examples, you must have python>=2.7
